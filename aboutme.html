                        I'm a Year 1 student in Singapore Polytechnic and I'm passionate about all things concerning our environment.
                        From a young age, I've found myself being amazed and appreciative of the Earth, nature and geography.
                        However, our Earth is facing threats like global warming and in order to preserve our ecosystems
                        for us and the future generations to appreciate, we have to take action against global warming together!

                    <p>
                        I enjoy going for hikes in Singapore's nature reserves and running as it  allows me to
                        destress especially after a hectic week of school. I am passionate in coding as it
                        allows me to be creative with my problem solving. Lastly, I also hold a fondness for 
                        animals.

                        <br>
                        I like to keep an open mind and try out new activities as it is a good opportunity for me
                        to learn, find out more about myself and grow.

            <div class = "grid-item personality">
                <h1>My Personality</h1>
                    <p> 
                        I am an introverted person. I enjoy solo activities and spending time alone. 
                        However, I enjoy spending time with a close group of friends once in awhile too.
                        Despite this, I am an effective communicator and I work well within a team during
                        school projects.
