                        SP's campus is home to roughly <b>230 different species of plants!</b> The presence of nature allows us to feel
                        relaxed and helps calm us down when we are stressed. It also improves the quality of our air.

                        Majority of the facilities on campus are equipped with <b>smart sensors</b> that monitors motion and air quality.
                        For example, lights along T7's corridor have motion sensors. This allows the lights to be turnt on only when
                        it is necessary and reduces electricity wastage.
