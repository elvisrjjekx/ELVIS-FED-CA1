                    The earth is getting significantly warmer due to global warming. 
                    It's a result of excessive greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and other pollutants getting collected in the earth's atmosphere.
                    These gases trap heat in our atmosphere, causing temperatures to rise.

                    I feel that all of us should make efforts to combat global warming regardless of how small the actions may be.
                    Small, consistent efforts will accumulate over time! Can you imagine the change if all of us were to take action?
                    Therefore, I am going to share with you 3 personal goals/habits that all of us can set to save the Earth.

                    <h1>Use Public Transporation</h1>  <!--Source: https://www.gov.sg/article/how-to-make-your-commute-a-more-sustainable-one-->
                    <p>
                        Sometimes, we drive to places which are just a 5 minute walking distance away or we choose to use
                        private hire apps. However, is it really necessary? An article about sustainable commuting on gov.sg 
                        said, a car uses 9 times the energy used by a bus. The same car also uses 12 times that 
                        of a train on a per passenger-kilometre travelled basis. Public transportation is more 
                        environmentally friendly option. It is also more friendly on your wallet! 
                        Let's adopt the practice of choosing public transportation whenever necessary.

                    <h1>Reduce Electricity Consumption at Home</h1>
                    <p>
                        In Singapore, our electricity is produced by burning natural gases which produces large amounts of carbon dioxide. 
                        One way we can reduce our consumption by switching to our lights to LEDs. LED lights are 80% more energy efficient
                        than fluorescent bulbs, and they require less electricity. We can also turn off switches when not in use
                        to prevent unnecessary electricity wastage.
                        Let's reduce energy consumption by using energy efficient appliances and turning off power supplies when not in use.

                    <p>
                        I know many of us are guilty of this one. When we throw food away, it ends upinto a landfill. When food rots, 
                        it produce methane, a greenhouse gas. According to NEA, Singapore produced a shocking total of 817,000kg of food waste in 2021 alone! 
                        Can you imagine how much methane was produced. Therefore, do your part by reducing food waste to save the Earth.
